## Progress
If you would like to join me, feel free to either grab a copy of this repo and create your own goals for the year, or snag the [template](./progress-2018) to make your own copy and add a link to it here.


## Abstract

I'm tackling my 2018 learning goals in true "Speedrun" style. My list contains far more courses than I expect I'll be able to complete in 2018, so it's sufficient that I can speedrun the year without running out of items from the list to learn.

Additionally, I'm including a variety of "bonus point" opportunities for reading books, completing projects, and completing algorithmic challenges.

**My goal is to :** 
1. see how many points I can rack up by December 31, 2019.
2. Complete atleast 2 Tiers(Min 1 Tier per semester) of the guide until up by December 2019.
3. Do atleast 2 Game dev speed-runs.
3. [Meet atleast one of these](###Meet-atleast-one-of-these).
4. Use those extra resources lying around for years and gain some points from them.
5. Give your best and exceed the above if possible.


## Rules

1. Always be working on one course.
1. Add bonus objectives from bonus list as often as desired.
1. All Assignments must be complete for course to be considered complete.
1. **Don't Quit.**
1. **Don't Panic!**

## Approach the items in the guide by these rules
### Power up your learning - make every minute count 
* When you're working through a book, type out the example code and do all the exercises.
* When you're working through a course, do all the assignments.
* When you're building a Project, include a build process (like [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)), include at least 5 automated tests ([Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html), [mocha](https://mochajs.org/), sinon, chai, jasmine, tape, whatever works for you), include a README.md file that clearly explains the project, and practice using [meaningful 
commit messages](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) 
* Use each project to demonstrate that you can deliver an optimized product. Implement tests (as I mentioned above), use your build process to minimize assets, use a linter (like [ESLint](http://eslint.org/)) on your JavaScript and have some method to your madness when it comes to your css naming conventions (like [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/))
* As you learn, take the time to discuss what you're learning with others: write blog posts, spend time actively discussing code and concepts with other developers (of varying skill levels), if you're comfortable with it - produce some helpful videos explaining topics that others might find daunting, and (most importantly) embrace the opportunity to help others one on one. You never know something so thoroughly as when you take the time to deeply consider it and explain it to someone else who might be struggling. Helping others doesn't just benefit them, it benefits you by increasing your understanding and mastery of the topic. Help people - you'll learn a lot in the process - you'll be a better developer for having done it. 


### Meet atleast one of these
* have git commits every week, most of the days of the week
* try to get in one of [@tropicalchancer's cohorts](https://chingu-cohorts.github.io/chingu-directory/) - be active once you're in
* try to pick one to two other languages to use regularly for solving algorithms and implementing projects in addition to JavaScript (good choices would be to pick one of C++, Java or Python and one of Golang or Rust).
* spend 30 minutes a day studying math on Khan Academy
### For each item you should:
* take notes, on a blog, in markdown, wherever, somewhere - not about what you read, or about what the instructor said - about what you learned
* build something - even if it's just a 20 line function that computes something you find interesting
* if you build something, document it and test it as appropriate
* do the exercises, build the projects - fully, not some scaled down halfassery

### For four projects of your choosing
* Seek 1-3 other developers to collaborate on the project
* Coordinate with the team to complete the project
* Build the project out to a full production quality application
* Invite others who are not associated with the team to rigorously test the final product.
* Resolve any legitimate issues found

### Once per month - do two or more of the following:
* Write up a comprehensive blog post or markdown entry in a repository detailing the high points of what you learned that month
* Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NIb9l3imAo) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5-tdAwclo) - on interviewing
* Read [this](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.co.uk/2007_09_01_archive.html) - on crafting a resume
* Do one lesson from [CUST104: Business Communications](https://learn.saylor.org/course/view.php?id=345)
* Live stream what you're working on for an hour. Or, lend a hand to someone who needs help by screensharing and walking them through it.
* Catch up on industry reading on sites like [Joel on Software](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/), [Coding Horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/), [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/), [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com/articles), [UX Myths](http://uxmyths.com/), [JavaScript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/)

### Practice stuff
* sign up for https://www.codingame.com - finish every training challenge up through "very hard", for the hard and very hard challenges, you'll likely need to have worked down the main list in this post to the data structures book
* learn [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/guide)
* Join one of the Chingu cohorts that @tropicalchancer puts together and actively participate on one or more group projects
* Project: Clone [this](https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-creative/) landing page
* Project: Clone [this](https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-clean-blog/) blog template - note that there are multiple pages
* Project: Clone [this](https://creativemarket.com/ikonome/686585-Material-Resume-Blue/screenshots/#screenshot2) online resume template
* Project: Clone the front page of [this](https://urbanarmorgear.com/) website modifying it to highlight a different product or industry. Make special note of the secondary navigation bar at the top. Implementing that is the highlight of this project.
* Project: Do one of the FCC projects not listed in this guide.
* Goal: Contribute one pull request per month to an open source project of your choosing.

**Some advanced stuff**

* pick a pet web development project you can code in a week and complete it
* code an android application
* learn golang or rust and complete any of the backend projects from FCC with that language as the backend language
* redo any of the algorithmic type projects you've already completed from the list, in a language other than JavaScript
* pick an open source project from [Code Triage](https://www.codetriage.com/) and contribute to fixing an open issue
* code a flash cards application, for jotting quick notes you can use to quiz yourself later
* hit hackerrank and complete the Project Euler problems

## FAQ for this guide

### Why is it so much longer than the original Job Ready Guide?
What I've observed over the past 9 months is two phenomena, the first being that many "self-supplemented" with additional beginner projects and resources while working through YDKJS, so I expanded on the beginner section to alleviate the "but what else should I be doing" question. The second is that the most successful learners also supplemented with more involved projects towards the end of the guide, so I added more intricate/advanced projects to meet that need.

### Why so much Math and Algorithms?
It's not THAT much math, just through Precalculus so you won't feel so behind the curve when you want to push beyond just "Job Ready" and tackle more involved programming projects. The algorithms -- I've added them to ensure you're prepared and confident you can handle anything you might encounter in an interview.

### Where should I deploy my code?
For all projects - store your code on GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket (GitHub preferred if you want it to later be seen by potential employers) and for web projects deploy the code on the web using the service of your choice ([GitHub](https://pages.github.com/) or [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/features/pages/) projects or [Surge.sh](http://surge.sh/) are ideal for frontend only projects, while Heroku is a free alternative for backend/fullstack).

### Why the change in Project selections?
To provide a bit more guidance in selecting a variety of projects that will involve a variety of front end development work (animations, media, etc).

### Do you have a list of helpful links to point me in the right direction if I need a productive break, or need to consult the official docs while I'm working through all this?
